After many, many months of development, my first iOS project is now in the App Store. It's a utility app for sorting places into the most efficient way to get there, from the site:

<blockquote><em>Where's Next?</em> takes the places you need to visit and according to where you are now tells you the quickest way to visit them.</blockquote>

I've spent the last month or two slowly polishing off and fixing bugs on the project I started before the start of this year with the intent of learning iOS development.

I could have released (and "finished") it a long time ago, but being a perfectionist, it had to be right before I submitted it. With it's limited feature set, I now think it is ready for release. It's said that you should be embarrassed with your 1.0 and I am. It only implements the core idea, but this means that there are many possibilities for the future.

With all projects, this wouldn't have happened without those who I leaned on:

* Without [Dr Nick Outram](http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/noutram)'s iPhone Programming Course, I'd probably still be trying to master Cocoa and not releasing my own apps and [having a job doing it](http://nickcharlton.net/post/starting-at-rokk-media).
* The icon was produced by [Ulrik Stoch Jensen](http://ulrikstoch.com/), a young icon designer from Denmark who I found through Dribbble. He's fantastic to work with and even put up with my backseat designing.
* Those who helped test: [Chris Hunt](http://thisisthechris.co.uk/), [Luke Davies](http://manateegames.co.uk/) and [Georgie Aggett](http://georgiejabbers.com/) and provided valuable feedback.
* Those on [Forrst](http://forrst.com/posts/Little_project_Ive_been_working_on-sYT) who provided me some confidence in the site design.
* and many others who I've spent hours and hours talking to about it.

Thanks guys, you're awesome.
