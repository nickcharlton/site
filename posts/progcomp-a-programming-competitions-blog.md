Last week I launched [ProgComp](http://progcomp.tumblr.com/). The idea is to produce a continuing flow of curated programming competitions.

I think competitions are a great way to stretch peoples' minds on problems they would not otherwise encounter. There are lots of things to learn across many different fields in Computer Science, from data handling algorithms to neural networks in AI and Physics in games.

The hope is to over time produce a site where you can find open and available competitions, covering a variety of different subject areas.

Obviously, I cannot do this alone, so, if you hear of any upcoming competitions, please [submit it here](http://progcomp.tumblr.com/submit).
