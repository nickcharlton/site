[Watts Martin talks about the "default narrative" which pervades journalism][post].

Basically this. I don't read most technology news any more because it's almost 
always scraping the bottom of the barrel crap. And bar one or two writers, this 
default way of thinking is all over Apple "journalism", too. 

It stinks.
