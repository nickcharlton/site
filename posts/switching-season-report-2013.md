[Alex Payne looks at the alternatives to his current setup and draws some conclusions][post].

In his article, he's put words to things I've so far been unable to describe to 
people myself:

> "the Galaxy S4 is uninspired but good"

> "does not feel like a premium product. It is plasticky and sort of embarrassing 
> to carry around, though its cheapness does lend it a sense of devil-may-care 
> durability."

And, then:

> Let’s not even speak of the system fonts, ugly but ignorable on a phone and 
> downright offensive on a tablet. No, while much improved from several years ago, 
> one does not use Android in 2013 for its looks.

On Linux as a deskop:

> "Trying to compute like a normal with Linux is, after all these years, still an
> exercise in masochism."

Yep.

I sometimes get to play around with Android devices (it's interesting to see how
they're changing), and recently I acquired a ZTE One to have a look at [Firefox OS][].
I'm intending to write a review about that soon.
