Yesterday was Digpen VI, down at the Eden Project in Cornwall. It was a wonderful
day spanning a breadth of different topics, and at a nice location.

It's quite fantastic to see how far Digpen has come from where it started. Way back
when [in 2011, we had 80 people in a classroom at Plymouth University][first], to
now having a full day of talks, split across two tracks, covering a wide selection
of web topics and all at a lovely venue. [Sophie][] put much of it down to the
community itself &mdash; this is certainly true, it's a diverse group of people far
more happy to put more into it than they take out &mdash; but without her (and Andy's
steering) behind it, it wouldn't be what it is today.

The talks started off with [Matt Connelly][matt] talking about using some data analysis
techniques to trace where [Iteracy][]'s clients have come from. This was rather fascinating.
The root message here was to suggest that whilst certain smaller clients may not
seem so worthwhile at the time, without looking at the data you don't know where
this project will lead &mdash; it could well be a much larger project.

[Chris][] then went on to talk about the [Moby Dick Big Read][mobydick], and the 
technical (and human) challenges that occur when a project relies on a large 
amount of people (none of whom technical) and suddenly becomes rather 
popular[^server]. This was followed by a break, after which we split into two tracks.

I'm not usually much of a fan of conferences with different tracks. [FOSDEM][] or
[ORGCon][] for example, always felt like you were missing out on something. But
this was done well. In fact, the track I followed hah a bit of a [dConstruct][] vibe 
to it. But, the other track quite successfully seemed to fill in the more technical
side (from those I talked to after.)

[Will][] talked about making time for projects outside of the day job, of planning
out long term ones and making it all fit in. He emphasised planning out as much as
possible, splitting big jobs into managable ones and allowing bits of projects to
slot in where they can. He also referenced [Merlin Mann][]'s ideas of deliberately
planning and making time for everything. Of keeping the devices tucked away when
it's most appropriate and planning blocks of time to keep us present at all of the
things that matter.

Following this, [Dan Goodwin][] talked about not reading and not following 
everything. Because it's impossible, and so we shouldn't feel bad about it. As long,
of course, as we are doing something to keep current. After this was lunch, and a
chance to explore the Eden Project. Even in a low-season like it is at the moment,
it's a fanastic place to explore.

After lunch, [Stuart Marsh][] talked about how, and the motivations behind building
his service, [Issue Pop][]. Much like Matt's talk at the start of the day, it's great
to see people sharing this side of projects and their businesses. Whilst we're
happy to write about or stand up and talk about the design or technical sides of
our businesses, it's still a little taboo to talk about the actual business side.
After this, [Dan][] gave a nice and accessible introduction to Design for Developers.
If you're in the same boat, I suggest picking up a copy of [Design for Hackers][],
it'll cover much of what he spoke about and the bits he didn't quite have time to
fit in, too.

To close off the end of the day was [Jo and Stephen][] talking about maintaining
our creativity. They mostly focused around design and illustration, but everything
transfers well to programming too[^creativity]. Their tips and stories centred around
getting away from everything, and working on other things away from work &mdash;
especially in other mediums. My main take away from this, was a reminder that if it
isn't fun, what's the point? And that we can, with a bit of planning, keep our
creativity, even at the hardest of times.

The whole day was wonderful, especially for catching up with all of the friends I've 
made over the years over Devon and Cornwall. The last few weeks have been damn hard,
so it also worked as a perfectly timed burnout antidote.

[^server]: And yes, it was me who moved it over to the different server. The host 
           hadn't done anything to transfer it properly. But, fortunately, 
           Wordpress (and Apache, MySQL, etc) is easy and simple enough to configure.

[^creativity]: Programming is as creative as anything else is. It just has a lot of
               other constraints, be it design patterns, architectures or technical
               limitations. Programming is nothing like building widgets. Even if
               you've built a very similar product before.
