This month's lecture was delivered by [Thomas Hackner](http://www.hackner-security.com/), from the [University of Applied Sciences, Hagenberg, Upper Austria](http://www.fh-ooe.at/en/). 

It was certainly an interesting talk, he covered the various standards (ISO 27001:2005), and pointed out a few case studies, and points often over looked. This was then followed up with a demonstration, and "practical" showing lock picking.

## Points

* Electronic door access systems often just control the door latch, rather than the deadbolt itself. 
	- this means that typically, it is possible to circumvent the latch using a piece of plastic. Most systems will also not log door openings, leaving such entrances undetected.
* Entry systems that use PIN code systems should be changed regularly, otherwise it will eventually be obvious to a casual visitor what the code is.
* There is usually a simple to identify weakest link in a Physical system, much like any other system.
	- an example given was an industrial fridge in student accommodation in Austria. To open the whole fridge it was secured by a much simpler lock than the individual compartments.
* People generally disclose more information over an internal phone system.
	- this is most likely because they assume you are trusted for using it.
* In a report in 2008, the Financial Services Authority found that 10/39 small and large companies in the financial industry had basic lapses of security.
	- in most cases they had implemented solutions like CCTV, and PIN code access on doors, but simply left those doors open, for example.
* Other examples highlighted oversights such as:
	- access to server rooms with visitor passes
	- keypad entry systems, but leaving main doors open
	- in companies where they had been implemented, 8/10 of the employees questioned had no idea, or only a cursory understanding of a clear desk policy.
* Another example given was of an [Airport in Rome which had no security overnight](http://www.securitypitfalls.org/2010/02/security-is-no-matte.html). This meant that someone was able to walk through the airport, potentially planting banned objects.

## In Conclusion

Overall, it was a good talk. The examples showed where people often overlook potential security policies, and the relevance of physical penetration testing. On display where [Practical Lock Picking: A Physical Penetration Tester's Training Guide](ttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1597496111?ie=UTF8&tag=nisbl-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1597496111) and [Unauthorised Access: Physical Penetration Testing for IT Security Teams](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0470747617?ie=UTF8&tag=nisbl-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0470747617) which should hopefully stir on my initial interest further.
