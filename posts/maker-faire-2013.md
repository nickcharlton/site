Last weekend was [Maker Faire UK][], up in Newcastle. [Stewart][], [Dan][] and I
headed up (aided by Stewart's Dad's supurb driving skills), part of us from Exeter
and Dan from Nottingham. 

My journey started on the 6:55 train out of Plymouth to get to Exeter for around 
8:00, from there we set off on the drive to Newcastle, via Nottingham. It's quite 
the trip; we landed at the [Life Centre][] by about 18:00 with just about enough
time to setup, grab something to eat, find the hotel and then crash in preparation
for Day 1 of the Maker Faire.

Our plan for being there was two fold; one was to evangelise 3D printing (as in,
the stuff you can do on your desk) and secondly to help sell a few RepRap kits by
promoting [Printed Worlds][]. To do this we bought along a RepRap and spent the
weekend printing off whistles. These make a cool demonstration as just off the
printer they essentially work (you just have to poke the ball that's printed inside
of the body). We gave away a few to slobbery children (and, er, adults.) We'll see
how successful it ends up being in the next few weeks[^buy].

For the evangelism side, this worked rather well. In the photo above you can see
Dan explaining the purpose of a printed part to a group of people (this is likely 
a hotend assembly, although it's hard to tell.)

And, as you can see below, we regularly had a rather huge group of people crowded
around. The working RepRap (which was printing those whistles) can be blamed for
much of it. It was a great crowd puller.

Overall, we had an interesting mix of people come over to the stand. A small proportion
hadn't heard all that much about 3D printing, had seen the RepRap going and came 
over to see what was going on. A much larger proportion had heard of 3D printing
and were subsquently rather impressed with what we were doing and indeed, impressed
with the price of the kit we were promoting. And a few others knew quite a bit
(these often had RepRap's or MakerBots or one of the many others that exist) and
were more interested in us personally; that was pretty cool. 

Another thing that was nice to see was design and technology teachers talking about
what they were either doing, or thinking about doing with a 3D printer. This is
already something that Stewart has been doing with local schools and colleges around
Exeter; the students can work on their project in the morning (say, learning CAD)
and then by the afternoon print it and see it as a real object. As someone who was
quite uninspired after making the fifth wooden box at school, I can see this as
being quite revolutionary &mdash; especially on the motivation front.

At the end of day one, we were fed and then head off in search of a pub. Firstly,
we ended up at Newcastle's Brew Dog Pub (which was rather nice), but then I suggested
meeting up with [Adam][], who was in town, and a few other makers at a Weatherspoon's 
closer to the venue. Here we ended up meeting [Oli Wood][] and a bunch of other people. 
And had a fine time. Day 2 then followed, with slightly less, but still quite a lot
of people. After closing time, we packed up, found something to eat and then turned
in. We were leaving at 7, afterall.

As a "maker" myself, it was fascinating seeing everyone else's creations. From
[Pancake Bot][] to the Pole Dancing Robots in the photo above, there were lots of
things to see. There was also a good showing from the many [Hack Spaces][] around the
country; notably [Nottingham][] who had a huge stand.

Exhibiting at Maker Faire, and the faire itself was great fun. I hope to be at the
next one. But in the mean time, I'll likely next be at the [Brighton Mini Maker 
Faire][] in September.
