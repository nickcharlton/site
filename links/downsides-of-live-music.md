[Adam Keys on Live Music][post].

All of this, basically. I love the *idea* of live music, but so often it turns out 
to not be quite as a good as you imagine it to be. And, much like Keys, I listen to 
albums in a long-form way. Sometimes a whole artist's discography in an evening 
(and for some, over a day). I much prefer it that way.
