Much to my chagrin about Medium in general, there's been some nice posts recently. 
This set on Side Projects fits exactly where I feel about them;

* [Lee Munroe talks about what he's learned with doing side projects][lee].
* [Ximena Vengoechea talks about them being the "new resume"][ximena]. 

I like this idea, and as I redo mine (I've technically graduated now[^job]) I'm 
adjusting mine to focus on these equally with everything else.

[^job]: I'm not looking for a job, as I'm intending on doing a Masters. However, I'm 
    open to taking on freelance projects, if you have them.
