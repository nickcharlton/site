* With [Storm Ciara][6] bringing wind gusts of up to 60mph, I ended up not
  cycling all week. There's not much fun (and safe) cycling to be had in those
  sorts of wind speeds,
* I spent a good chunk of time this week working on [Appraisal][1], and I'm
  really happy about that. It's been falling behind with everything since
  [Bundler 2.0][2] was released, and my approach of ignoring it wasn't going to
  last forever. I closed a bunch of PRs, opened a few [more related to Ruby
  versions][3] and [accepting paths][4] (which should [speed up builds on
  Administrate][5]),
* For many months, I've been working on replacing our office internet and
  network and this week, because we're also building a new meeting room it
  stepped up a gear into planning out what we should do. It's quite fun doing
  this stuff again (I did this sort of thing early in my career). But perhaps
  I'll think differently after rewiring a forty-two port patch panel,
* All of this is in contrast to spending the main part of this week regularly
  stuck on what I'm supposed to be working on. Some parts through architectural
  complexity, some through people not being around and some from
  less-than-ideal prior planning. Here's to hoping we can solve that next week.
* I enjoyed reading about [The Wall of Technical Debt][7] this week. Unlike a
  lot of articles, it's correct around what technical debt really is (a set of
  trade-offs) and (most importantly), has some nice suggestions around exposing
  the costs to everyone on the team,
* And also [Agile as Trauma][8] and [this associated Twitter thread][9], which
  talks about the position the Agile manifesto comes from and some of the
  drawbacks today. I've seen a lot of the points mentioned.
