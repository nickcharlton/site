* This was the week where Coronavirus/COVID-19 mitigations really stepped up,
  especially for people (like me!) working for predominantly US companies. In
  the absence of stronger advice and organisations where working remotely is
  relatively easy, this is a good move,
* On that, we moved to being fully remote for the foreseeable future. I've got
  a pretty good setup in this regard as I already do this once a week.
  Ergonomics are important to me; if I just work on my laptop I get tired
  faster and my back aches horribly,
* In other news, I published an [Administrate security vulnerability this
  week][1]. This is the first time I've gone through this process, which
  started a couple of weeks back with Benoit Côté-Jodoin from Shopify emailing
  us to let us know. I then ended up using an interview to pair on the
  potential solution and using [GitHub's new private fork functionality][2].
  All in all, the most difficult part of this process was writing up the
  advisory itself, making something clear and not accidentally withhold
  something important.
