I've read a lot of software books, some much better than others. I've found
that I'm often recommending a standard set and thought that it was time to
write them down.

I've sorted them into the order I'd recommend reading them, but each section is
a different theme. Whilst, I'd recommend reading them all, I'd expect it take
you at least a decade. They're books for a deep career and not one to speed-run
your way through.

As and when I discover more, I'll come back to this list and update it.

## People & Process

* Art of Agile Software Development
  * It's a book about XP (extreme programming). It's how I work and think about
    solving problems with code and teams. There's so many on the topic, but
    this is the most comprehensive overview
* The DevOps Handbook
  * A good idea worth fighting for against a constant of "DevOps teams" which
    miss the point, it's really about collaboration and process.
* Accelerate
  * What's actually effective at improving processes? This is the book that
    came out of the original DORA research and has lots of evidence backing to
    ideas you'll learn from elsewhere.
* Time Management for Systems Administrators
  * There's always a lot to do, both urgent and long-term. This has really
    helped me think of ways keep the long-running projects moving, along with
    those urgent incoming tasks.
* Thinking in Systems

## Management

* The Manager's Path
  * parts about why organisations are structured the way they are
* High Output Management
  * introduced the idea of the regular 1-on-1, also talks about organisations
    and projects as systems

## Software Design

* Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby
  * perhaps the only language-specific book which I feel should make the list
  * it's the best book I've read to really understand OO design
  * and if you write a lot of Rails, really make you annoyed with "service"
    objects
* Domain-Driven Design Distilled

## The Patterns Books

These are not books you read cover-to-cover, but rather a bit of them and then
find yourself coming back to time and again. I say to people to not be put off
by the word "enterprise", but rather think of them as "robust" and "universal".
I've usually read the first few chapters, then dipped in and out when the need
has arisen â€” once you know it's there somewhere, you'll know when to come back
to it.

* Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture
* Refactoring
* Working Effectively with Legacy Code
* Enterprise Integration Patterns
  * It's about implementing messaging systems predominantly but does cover
    others too and will help you think about a lot of the different patterns
    that can be applied to different problems where multiple systems need to
    interact.
