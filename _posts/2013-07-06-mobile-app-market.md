[Graham Lee talks about the way the app market has ended up going][post].

I've seen his conclusion myself. The leads I've had recently have been for either 
building a specific user experience, or an interface to a wider system through some 
sort of API. The thing is, these projects are far, far more interesting than the 
crap that proceeded it.

But, it's not necessarily good for those of us who wish we had a more early-2000's 
Mac software environment &mdash; the likes where [Panic][], [Red Sweater Software][] 
and many more can shine through with dedicated end-user customers.
