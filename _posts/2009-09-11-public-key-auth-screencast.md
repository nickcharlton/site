title: Public Key Auth Screencast

After a request by <a href="http://twitter.com/nickcharlton/status/3884874880">Peter Upfold</a> on Twitter for ideas for a screencast, I suggested he do something on Public Key Authentication. My wish was made true as he made it up yesterday. 

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/6523718" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/6523718">Set Up Public Key Authentication for SSH 
on the Mac</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/peteru">Peter Upfold</a> on <a 
href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

I was rather surprised to hear myself mentioned, so a huge hat tip (presumes a huge hat, I guess...) to Peter for doing that.

Thanks!
