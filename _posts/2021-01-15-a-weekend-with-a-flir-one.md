I spent a couple of weekends back playing around with a [Flir ONE][1], a
thermal camera which attaches to a phone. I'd been working on a project which
involved some gnarly drilling and was concerned I'd hit a pipe — it turned out
as a good excuse to give one a go.

It's a really neat device which worked well for my needs but is let down by
some fairly average software. The model I used was a few years old (the newer
ones have a much higher resolution) but this wasn't a significant problem for
my intended use-case. As an example of the things I found: the device would
often disconnect whilst in use, sometimes during filming something which
required stopping, resetting and starting again. The view would "flash out"
completely; I wondered if this was a regular recalibration, but I couldn't work
out a consistent behaviour for it. Finally, the software just didn't really
follow iOS design affordances: lots of bits of UI which had no feedback or
touch controls which were far too small.

Whilst I had it, I ended up taking a bunch of photos and some short videos of
various things:

I rented it for a weekend from someone locally using [Fat Llama][2] which
worked out really well. I picked it up on Saturday morning and dropped it off
on the Monday for £30. It was great fun to have for a weekend, but with some of
the annoyances I don't think I'd buy one.
