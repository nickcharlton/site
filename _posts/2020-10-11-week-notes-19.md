title: "Week Notes #19"

* Last week was the end of a — long for me — nine-month project. It was not
  the easiest nor was it working in a particularly exciting to me technology
  (React and later React Native) but I learned a lot. And spent a lot of time
  in Zoom calls,
* Unfortunately, the client has been badly affected by COVID-19 so the project
  ended up finishing much earlier than we'd hoped for (it's nice to actually
  finish the work you start!) and a little abruptly: the last week was
  wrapping up everything we could, leaving notes and fixing a load of small
  annoyances I'd wanted to for months,
* But that did open up an opportunity to take some time off, so this week
  (and also next) I've been working on my own stuff. A mix of fixing things
  which I'd wanted to, but were much more involved than I could find the time
  for plus trying out a few new things,
* I started off by profiling my `zsh` configuration; it'd gotten horribly
  slow. I started off with 1.33 minutes (!), and got it down to 0.08 seconds
  by switching [`nvm` (the main culprit)][9] and [`jabba` to lazy-load][10].
  It was a lot easier to do than I expected, I started off by [profiling as
  explained in this article][6] and then [trying out a few lazy][7] [loading
  approaches][8],
* I spent Monday and Tuesday on [Administrate][11] and closed 74 issues and
  PRs! I enjoy working on this project (when I get the time), but it's a lot
  of work to keep on top of and I usually find I drop behind for a few months
  at a time and then the backlog becomes somewhat overwhelming. My goal this
  year has been get below 50 open issues and 30 open PRs and as I write this
  we're on 65 and 31 respectively, so it looks like I might actually make it,
* For a long time, I've been working on a tool for pulling my bank data into
  [YNAB][12] (an application which has been fairly transformative for me),
  it's just for me so it works out as a good platform for experimenting on.
  It was feature complete about a year ago until the service I was using to
  pull UK bank data was shutdown and since I've been building out a UI so
  that you could log in to it. This is is needed because the (relatively new)
  Open Banking APIs in the UK require the end user to click through to
  confirm — previously it was a Rails app which just had Sidekiq to run some
  background jobs for syncing,
* Anyway, I've been working with [Tailwind][13] on and off for a while plus
  using [Tailwind UI][14], and this week I added [Stimulus][3] to do some
  interaction. After spending most of the year working on a huge React app,
  Stimulus is very satisfying: much closer to the way the browser actually
  works so you're not fighting with someone else's interpretation of how it
  should be and so little unexpected magic (which I always felt with
  [Redux][15]) [and the docs are relatively tiny][4],
* Like many people, I have a bit of an aversion to the _huge_ amount of
  classes you end up putting in a "component" and my first instinct was to
  extract these out (in the original version of this project, that's exactly
  what I did). But it took hours of working out naming and revisiting CSS
  conventions. I'm building a menu that I'm very likely to never touch agin,
  what's the point? I think the individual component solution is going to be
  [ViewComponent][2], which I'm going to try out soon,
* Finally, I picked up a [Thinkpad T470s][16]. I have — for about the last
  three years or so — been thinking about trying to run Debian and the
  [i3 tiling window manager][17] and see how I go with it. It's been good so
  far, but my expectations are to use it for messing about with, rather than
  anything more; can you imagine having to piss about with `xrandr` to get a
  presentation to work in a client meeting? nightmare-ish.
