* I've started a new habit this year of tidying up my desk before I leave at
  the end of a Friday, now when I return on a Monday morning it's nice and tidy
  and ready to go, it's very nice!
* I finished [_How To Do Nothing_][1] last week. It's an excellent read and I'd
  definitely recommend it, but it is one of those books you might just have to
  read at least twice,
* Then moved onto [Louis Theroux's _Gotta Get Theroux This_][2], plus the [_99%
  Invisible City_][3], both of which have been good,
* I bottled the first beer I mentioned previously yesterday, so far spot on on
  the expected alcohol percentage so I'm excited to try this in two weeks'
  time,
* Otherwise, lots of writing (which takes ages) in the background, plus a bit
  of a site redesign I've been working on for a few months.
