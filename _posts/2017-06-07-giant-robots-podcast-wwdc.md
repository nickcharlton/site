If [starting to co-host Build Phase][co-host] wasn't enough, [Chad Pytel][] and
I did a [WWDC][] cross-over episode of [Giant Robots][], the main company
podcast.

We ran through the news out of the [main keynote][] and parts of the [Platforms
State of the Union][] (the developer keynote) and what we thought about in just
about an hour. It was good fun and a bit different to talk about something
which is all tech news. I hope we'll do it again!

to podcasts.
