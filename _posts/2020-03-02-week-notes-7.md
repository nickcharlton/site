* Last week, I released a [new version][1] of
  [`administrate-field-nested_has_many`][2],
* These last two weeks have been interesting in that there's been lots going
  on …and none of that I can publish. After doing this seven times, I'm pleased
  about how much I really do operate in the open,
* [Tailwind UI][3] came out this week, I've been following along through the
  [Art of Product podcast][4] and spent some time playing around with it this
  weekend. I'm still on the fence with [Tailwind][5]. It's a utility-first CSS
  framework and so to work with it you add classes to build up what you need.
  For prototyping this means you'll write a _lot_ of classes, but these can
  then be [extracted out into components][6]. I haven't quite done enough with
  it yet, but I'm undeniably productive with it and so I'm holding back my
  old-school don't-mix-content-with-presentation ethos,
* Finally, I switched to [Jetbrains Mono][7] as my terminal font. Ligatures
  finally make error handling in Go and the awkward bits of JavaScript look
  nice!
