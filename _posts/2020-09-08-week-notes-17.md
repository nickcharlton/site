* I'm now three weeks into having a standing desk and I've been doing a 50/50
  split of sitting and standing ever since. The most interesting thing so
  far — and also one of the things I was very excited about — has been that
  I'm no longer so tired after work. I've been finding that standing keeps me
  going much longer (or, maybe, consistently?) which has always been something
  I've struggled with,
* Another thing has been that I think I've split the past feeling of tiredness
  and hunger at the end of the day: I can stop working, go and do something
  else and then have dinner a bit later instead of needing to go eat right at
  the point I finish. It's much nicer.
* But I just had a week off where I did as little as possible apart from
  sorting out this and that, a spot of gardening and visiting my Mum for the
  first time eight months. It was particularly noticeable after a few
  stressful weeks!
* In other news, I bought a NAS (network attached storage device). On the plan
  it was an investment, I got a [Synology DS1520+][1] which will fit five
  drives (it is a little excessive!) plus the first 4TB HDD. I'll be getting
  more drives over the next six months. More to write up here on my plans for
  it, but all the obvious stuff: backups, making some media accessible and
  [a few][3] [utility VMs][2].
