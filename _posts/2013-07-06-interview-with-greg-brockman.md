[This interview with Greg Brockman of Stripe is quite interesting.][post].

It touches on the way they manage their development teams at Stripe, breaking into 
teams for parts of the different projects with one of the programmers leading. It's 
a good demonstration of how you can function a company around the way Open Source 
projects are run and using various different tools (in this case [GitHub][], [Asana][]
, etc) to glue things together.
