[Nate Seidle of SparkFun talks about their upcoming building][post].

I've &mdash; suprisingly &mdash; seen a few building designs over the years, and 
they're always cool to see. When I was on [placement][], we moved to a new office
building and had to plan out all of the data drops on both floors, and today I
saw a bundle of architect's plans for an interesting project in Plymouth (that,
obviously, I can't talk about.)

But, what's very cool to see here is SparkFun openly documenting it all. Much of
this stuff gets lost in folders of paperwork after the project is completed and
all of the contractors move on.
