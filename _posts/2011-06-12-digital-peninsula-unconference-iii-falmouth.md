Yesterday was the third iteration of the Digital Peninsula Unconference, at [University College Falmouth, Tremough](http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/).

Once again, it was a great event, with a panel/session on Agile methodologies, a focus on two possible projects (website and store), and once again a set of lightening talks by various people. Then there was a BBQ down on the beach (though, I didn't go to that bit.)

I also took photos this time. The lighting was much better at this venue than in [Exeter](http://nickcharlton.net/post/digital-peninsula-unconference-ii-exeter), but there still was a lot of blurry shots. They certainly could have been better (shooting these things with a 50mm is quite an impractical pain...), but I'm not too displeased with them.

Anyway; [you can find them here on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nickcharlton/sets/72157626820736307/), as always.
