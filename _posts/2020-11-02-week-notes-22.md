* It's been the end of the first part of _Review Season_ this week, a time
  where I spend an unreasonable amount of time staring blankly at a text
  editor trying to come up with anything to say. It's that perfect
  combination of dreadfully difficult but also concerningly meaningful which
  leads me to deep writers block. _vvvvroooommmmmmm_ the deadline goes, as
  it flies by â€¦and then suddenly words happen and manic typing begins. Except
  this time, with one illusive answer to the question of
  _what can x improve on?_ to leave me stuck once more,
* Because just sitting at a blinking cursor never really helps once you've
  been doing it for several hours, I tried to beat the rain by cleaning my
  two bikes on Friday afternoon in preparation for servicing them. I got most
  of my way through until it started raining right towards the end and then
  hastily hurrying everything in after having been working under torchlight
  for about half a hour. But now, a new chain, new brakes and two shiny
  looking bikes all ready to go, 
* As [another lockdown is due to start on Thursday][2], it was time to pick
  up [new running shoes][1] which, hopefully, will be the end of the bad
  series of injuries I've had this year,
* Otherwise, that's been just about it. Much of this week has been working
  down long issue lists and trying to review more Open Source PRs, slow but
  gradual progress!
