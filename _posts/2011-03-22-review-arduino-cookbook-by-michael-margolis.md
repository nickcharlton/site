For a while, I've wanted to play around with the [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/); the open source embedded hardware that's stuck it's claws into everything from the arts, to personal projects and much more. Then, [Arduino Cookbook](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596802486/) came up on the O'Reilly Blogger Review Program, and I couldn't say no to having a pushed look into it.

I think the Arduino Cookbook will fill the void between books for which their intention is to cover lots of programming fundamentals, and books which only cover the Arduino boards with a cursory mention.

Like most of O'Reilly's cookbooks, they intend to provide a group of solutions to common problems. Sometimes they feel a little filled out; the thought that this recipe and solution are only in there to fill a gap often comes to mind. With my limited Arduino experience, I didn't see this as much as with others, as a somewhat experienced programmer, the programming Chapters did feel a little bit long, but what is there does cover issues where you'd rather have an instant answer than not understand why something is the case.

Overall, I was impressed by what it covered. Notably, serial communication, sensors, driving motors, I2C communication and networking stand out. These are all required for the few projects I have in mind.

If you have any experience with lower-level microcontrollers (I have a little bit of experience with C on Microchips' PIC24 chip), you'll find some more advanced stuff like interrupts and timers towards the end. This is a welcome addition.

The appendixes should be rather useful for most; they cover a basic introduction to electronics, but, as the author says himself, it's not a replacement for a proper book on the subject.

The author suggests that it would be good for a variety of readers, personally, I think it will slot rather nicely into the likes of most programmers - especially those who wish to add something physical to their projects.

If you are looking for something to help complete a project, or just get started with the Arduino quickly this is probably the best bet. You'll find plenty in here to get you going.

_In the spirit of transparency, this review was written for the O'Reilly Blogger Review Program, because of that, they gave me a copy of the ebook for free._
