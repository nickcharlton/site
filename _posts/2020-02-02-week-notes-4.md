_I decided to skip last week's. Nothing of interest happened, outside of the
weekend which fits just as well here._

* Spent last weekend with my Mum, which was lovely. We started off a batch of
  homemade wine, which was great fun,
* Started using [Drafts][1] on inspiration from [Luke][2]. I'd previously been
  using [Bear][3] (which I've really liked), but I've been curious about
  Draft's actions since starting these Week Notes and automating what steps
  there are (manually breaking out long lines with links is a tedious process),
* I saw [_1917_ ][6] on Tuesday. It's a fascinating movie. The single shot
  style really draws you in and puts you right there with how bleak the WW1
  battlefield must have been. It's been a while since a film has stuck with me
  for several days, too,
* This weekend was spent in [mid-Wales, cycling a loop from Brecon][7] to
  [_Moel Prysgau_][4] bothy and then back to Brecon again. It was a very fun
  trip, starting off on the road, then some gravel forestry tracks towards the
  bothy. On the Sunday, we decided to go off-road and ended up fording four or
  five rivers working our way through. After that, we got back on the road to
  build up some momentum, eventually heading up through a very windy
  [Sennybridge ranges][5] on the way back to Brecon,
* This trip was helpful in making me realise where the shortcomings of my
  cycling fitness are. I need to do some long rides to improve my endurance
  and some time doing some hill-training wouldn't hurt either,
* It also made me realise how bad it is if you don't give it enough time to
  pack before leaving. I forgot a bunch of things (a mug, fork, etc.) and
  could've done with some spare shoes (my feet got very wet), which wouldn't
  have been a problem if I'd been able to take my time,
* Anyway, for various reasons that ended up being a very busy and hectic week.
  Let's hope the next is easier…
