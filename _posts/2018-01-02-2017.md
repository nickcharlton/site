2017 was a tough one.

This year was the start of the implementation of the bad things which came
about in 2016. Brexit, Trump and a further, significant, continuation of the
expansion of social, racial and economic inequality. Many of these things go
back a very long time and so if you're surprised by them, you've not been
paying enough attention.

For me, 2017 was exhausting and stressful. But also a time where I got to the
stage where I started finding myself and *doing* the sorts of things I've been
wanting to do.

At the end of 2016, I took over being the maintainer of [administrate][], a
popular open source project for building admin dashboards with Rails. It'd been
abandoned for much of 2016 and seeing a shitty issue irritated me enough to
take over maintaining it.

I started with a big issue and pull request backlog and since this has been a
relentless stream of work. With the help of my some of my amazing colleagues,
[Tyson Gach][] , [Pablo Brasero][] (to highlight two) and a wonderful
collection of external contributors ([Joel][], [Carlos][], [Ben][], [Rich][] 
and many more) we've been able to remove a large number of dependencies 
(including by implementing our own design/grid system), add a much-wanted 
feature in namespace support, kept track of Rails releases and have worked hard 
on our handling of internationalisation.

I was able to help get [// TODO London][todo] started by providing their
initial event space (something we'll be doing in 2018, too). This is
possibly the best London meetup and I'm very happy that this worked out so
well.

At [thoughtbot][], we've run three events of our own. [One about how
developers grow][dev-path-event], [one about design
sprints][design-sprint-event], and finally [about our company
playbook][playbook-podcast]. I helped with some of the filming of those
events, and along with [Bruno Antunes][] and [Luke Mitchell][] put
together a significantly updated version of our playbook ...and got it printed
into a real book!

I started co-hosting [Build Phase][], a podcast about iOS development (a
thing I once did a lot of, and now sadly do a lot less) ...but then
successfully allowed that to tail off completely. I also joined [Chad
Pytel][] for an episode of [Giant Robots][] as a reflection of WWDC
2017.

I was able to expand my interest in [Kubernetes][], [Go][],
[Docker][] and virtualisation, all of which I'm planning to write about in
2018.

Somewhere in here, I also managed to:

-   start brewing (full grain) beer and found my favourite recipe which
    produces a not-too-heavy dark beer (much like a mild),
-   view the 2017 eclipse in Wyoming with two great friends, followed by
    road-tripping from Colorado to San Fransisco ...then getting robbed when
    our car was broken into,
-   got to go down an abandoned part of the tube and an old air-raid shelter,
-   moved house from North London to Docklands sort-of-area with three friends
    who somehow are capable of putting up with me,
-   and probably reading the largest amount of books I ever have before.

As I began writing this, I was unsure of what 2017 had been (apart from seeing
it as a struggle). But as is often the case with reflecting on a year, it turns
out to have a lot more in there than you'd realised.

Sadly, I end 2017 only-mildly avoiding a serious burnout. If it's not the
burden of maintaining open-source projects (both those through work and those
of my own), trying to assist with sales and marketing efforts with work, or
just work in general, it's been a tough one.

For 2018, I'm focusing on *documenting and self-management*. For the former: a
combination of writing and at least one meetup talk. For the latter, aiming to
manage my time and well-being better to try and avoid burning out.

I want 2018 to be a year where I communicate better and mentor more.
