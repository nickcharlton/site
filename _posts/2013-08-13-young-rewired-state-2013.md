And so, sadly, that is the end of [Young Rewired State][yrs] for another year. Like
last year, I was a mentor down in [Plymouth][centre], where we had five participants
and (overall) three mentors.

Much like last year, this year was also incredible. After going through all of the
introductory material, then talking about sources of open data and technology 
options, we stepped back to give them some time to brainstorm. By the end of the
first day, they all had an idea of a project that they wanted to work on together.

This turned into [Things2Do][], a simple search driven service which collates a
combination of different data sources (for places, weather forecasts, movies, etc)
and combines these to give a smart result based on your location (and what you
wish to do). It looks like this:

For now, the area and some of the data is limited to just Birmingham (this was just
for testing), but I'm sure they'll fix that soon. It's also responsive and well
tested across a range of different devices (although, there is a few bugs here and
there). I'm really impressed with how far they came in just a week. They have some 
interesting plans for it in the future, so I'll be following along closely to see 
how it develops.

For the whole week, we were almost completely hands off. We did help with some 
debugging, cross-browser issues, suggestions on approaches & direction, and I got 
to indulge myself in [building a screenscraping tool and API][moviesapi] to provide
some data that otherwise was unavailable to them, but the outcome was all of the
team's effort.

The Festival of Code was great, too. We arrived at about three in the afternoon
after a &mdash; long and standing room only &mdash; train journey. In the evening,
Sam was on stage along with [TheraminHero][] and [Pixelh8][]. Then on Saturday 
morning, we had the first stage of judging, the "Heats" where the teams from 
different centres around the country presented their projects. Our group's and all 
of the others went extremely well, with only a few technical hitches, it was great.

Unlike last year, the final was kept to the Sunday. This meant everything was far
less rushed and as we had the heats in the morning, a free afternoon. Come Sunday, 
we filed into "Space 2", ready to see who had made it into the final. Sadly, our 
team didn't make it but they seemed more releaved in not having to do another demo! 
Seeing all of the other projects is always fascinating â€¦the [PiBike][] seemed to be 
a favourite for many people with whom I spoke with and by the end, it had won the
award for Best in Show.

I was hugely impressed by the judging, as I was last year. It's all well and good
having a panel of interesting people handling the judging process, but if they
don't ask the right kind of questions, debunk common fallacies[^design] and give
the presenters the space to get out what they mean to say, it is a huge
disservice to the people presenting. The judges handled it marvelously.

After a little bit of time running over, the event wrapped up and we headed for our
train. It was an interesting (and hilariously overcrowded) journey back after a
great week.

Over the weekend, [Chris][], [Sam][] and I talked about what we'd like to do with
YRS in the South West in the future. We'd like to see more people, over a much
greater area of Devon and Cornwall. Currently, the closest centre to us is Bristol 
&mdash; which isn't *really* the South West when you are used to being in Plymouth
or Exeter. We did hear of people wishing to come but finding Plymouth (in addition 
to getting to Birmingham) all too expensive for the travel. We'll be aiming to work 
out all of these for next year &mdash; we have several ideas for each of them.

Anyway, if you're interested, you can already [sign up for next year][2014] (as a 
mentor or as a partipant).
