* Quite a gap since I last wrote one of these; I recently rotated off a
  tough project which was taking up all of my time. But now I'm on something
  new and then had a lovely week off!
* [_The Food Almanac_][2] [via John][1] that's a collection of seasonal recipes
  and stories, which in turn lead to picking up [_An Everlasting Meal_][3]
  which I last tried in 2013 and didn't really get on with, but was reminded of
  again because of [Alicia Kennedy's newsletter][4] which I always look forward
  to reading. As I read it this second time, I'm realising I've (accidentally?)
  grown as a cook to do a lot of the topics covered, but I'm still learning a
  lot and I enjoy the little bits of recipes spread throughout,
* I've been focused on wrapping up stuff I'd started, and a few workflow
  optimisations the past few weeks,
* On my [dotfiles][6], I've been to removing some dependencies which have been
  causing some extra complexity and also trying to make them more portable.
  This has meant [removing base16][7], which I was using for colours and moving
  to something which relies more on the shell itself,
* Plus I've been trying to finish a very long in progress blog post around my
  desk and workplace setup which I started last year,
* I've also been planning out wood working projects for this year: replacing
  some table legs we use as a kitchen island, building several new planters.
  I've also been thinking a lot about building outside furniture, after being
  inspired by [this Laura Kampf video][5]. I don't quite have the amount of
  tools though!
