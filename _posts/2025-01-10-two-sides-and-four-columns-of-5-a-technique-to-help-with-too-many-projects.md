2024 sucked for various reasons, but when I'm not happy (over a long period of
time especially), I find I start far more projects than I get close to
finishing. I end up having far too many things in progress, where I'm
(consciously, or unconsciously) trying to work on multiple things at the same
time, continually thinking about what I'm _not_ doing, being stuck on one
project so others can't proceed, or missing out on new and other interesting
things because I'm too busy and stressed out with the amount of projects going
on.

Towards the end of last year, I resolved to try and get this under control by
trying out a new idea and review process: writing down all of the projects and
their current state, then reviewing this list every two weeks. I'd ask myself
these questions:

1. What projects are in progress?
2. What not-quite-a-project stuff is happening?
3. What should I kill?
4. Is this the right frequency to think about it?

Then I'd write down all of the projects in [a fancy notepad my partner bought
back for me from a trip to Japan which has two columns on it][1]. This notebook
sits to the left of my keyboard, so it's always in sight.

{% picture url: "resources/images/project-wip-notebook.jpeg"
           alt: "A photograph of an example of projects listed out. It shows
           two columns, because there's so many projects."
%}
  The notebook sits to the left of my keyboard, crossing them out whilst
  they're done.
{% endpicture %}


The first time I sat down and wrote down the projects, I ended up with two bits
of paper and four whole columns on them of projects I'd started but not
completed. Just doing this the first time really emphasised the state of
things. As the time went on, I'd cross off each item (or a sub-item, until I
could cross off the whole item).

Two weeks later, I returned to do it all again. Starting by looking at the
state of the current list, I'd take a new sheet and write out the projects
again. The crossed out ones would be gone, but any new projects would be added.

In the first review, I was surprised by how much I'd managed to get through.
I'd spent the time getting rid of as many projects as possible. Not that
excited about it? Archive it, and move on. Last thing to get it over the finish
line? Do that first. In these first two weeks, I'd managed to get down to just
two columns, on one sheet.

I continued this for several months (never getting it any smaller than two
columns), gradually crossing items out, bit by bit. Adding new projects as they
happened (but while being _very_ selective about those, to avoid making the
problem even worse and ending up back where I started). But, finally, as I
publish this, I'm down to just one column. Hopefully I can keep it that way.

Maybe something similar can work for you.
