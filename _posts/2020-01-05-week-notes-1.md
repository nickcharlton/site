Several people I follow post [#weeknotes][], which I've always found a
particularly interesting insight into what people are doing. I thought I'd
give it a go.

I plan to do a mix of work (when I can post about it), open source,
side projects and fitness & adventure topics, which I hope will keep it
interesting. Right. Here we goâ€¦

* I've been spending the past week diving deep into [Administrate][]'s issues
  and open PRs, looking for trends and building a taxonomy of labels,
* To do this, I ended up printing 204 index cards!
* So far, I've closed around 40 issues and PRs (most of which were out of date
  or duplicates),
* [Dan][] and I entered into the [Frontier 300][], a coast to coast 300km
  off-road cycle race from the Irish Sea to the North Sea in June,
* We then planned a weekend of [bikepacking in the New Forest][bikepacking]
  for March,
* And spent a long time talking about kit,
* I finished reading [The Man Who Cycled The World][], I enjoyed it a lot,
* At the start of the year, I always spend some time setting goals and thinking
  about what I want to do. I've done so again this year, with plans for many
  more long cycling trips, a side project I want to launch, getting a driving
  license (which I've said I'd do for years!) and a few more things. I didn't
  quite yet.
