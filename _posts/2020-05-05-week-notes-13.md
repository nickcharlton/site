* I got a fun new toy this week: The [new iPad Pro][3]. I went for the bigger
  screen this time (I've had a few over the years and developed a few iPad apps
  for them) and also got the [new keyboard which has a trackpad built in][4].
  The trackpad is curious, I still mostly tap the screen and don't feel I've
  gotten much out of it yet (the cursor changing dynamically is a cool UI
  effect though). Having a good keyboard will change things more, I'm aiming
  to write some of the workflow adjustments when I get more used to it,
* Part of this has been a plan to try and use my laptop less often, which has
  become more important during lockdown,
* My friend [Miles][2] released [Keep Touch][1], which prompts you on an
  interval you set to check in with those you love. We paired a little on some
  of the time calculations which was fun but also quite difficult to think
  about,
* Planted out some seeds this weekend, a mix of tomatoes, cucumbers, chillis
  and peas. I did quite a lot last year which worked out to be far too much, so
  slimmed it down this year,
* I made a point of making quite a few notes on what was difficult or just
  generally a pain to do. Watering was one of those, so I'm going to automate
  some of it to reduce the workload,
* Open source activity — as seen through my GitHub notifications — is peaky,
  which I find continually curious. In the UK we had a long weekend over Easter
  and it's taken me until this week to get through it all. But as we start this
  week it's gotten all quiet. You'd expect activity of others to jump once mine
  does, but this isn't all of it. I think it'd be an interesting thing to
  research.
