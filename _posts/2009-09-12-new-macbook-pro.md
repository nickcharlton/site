### Intro

Yesterday my new MacBook Pro arrived. It's a 2.66Ghz model with a Matte screen. It really is wonderful. It's certainly the fastest, and most custom machine I've had. Coupled with the [Apple Student Discount](http://nickio.posterous.com/a-few-notes-on-the-apple-education-store "A Few Notes on the Apple Education Store - Nick Charlton"), it does end up working affordable. 

Last night I tested out the power of this machine. There's various things which I couldn't do which I now can. Today [I took some photos](http://nickio.posterous.com/macbook-pro-some-photos "MacBook Pro: Some Photos - Nick Charlton") (ones of the Matte screen are rather thin on the ground).

### Flash

I can play Flash. Especially HD flash, I rather liked watching the HD shorts on Vimeo but this had to come to a halt a while back as I wasn't able to use it. It got to the point where I couldn't even use YouTube, so it's quite a difference.

Last night I watched some iPlayer content in HD - the difference in it not stuttering is quite different. 

Interestingly; Flash in Snow Leopard (could have also been before) is now a separate process. So Flash itself uses ~170% CPU, whilst Safari uses <10%. 

### Development

Development should be faster. I was having lag of minutes at times using TextMate, especially as I typically develop server side using ExpanDrive to aid with using SFTP. This also meant quite a few things have fallen behind where I'd like them, or I haven't put the effort in where I should. This really was a reflection of my main development environment rather than me, a pain, but now that bottleneck is gone.

So now, hopefully various things will be given a kick up the backside into getting started, finished or otherwise.

### In Conclusion

All in all, everything is great. Things are slotting together ready for my move over to Plymouth for University. So if you're around, pop me an email and visit!
