After a few weeks of work, this is "Version 4", of my blog. I have a slightly different design, and a different focus which should represent changes in me.

I do have a like of redoing some aspect of this every 6 months. I think it's a cross between me changing as a person, and my desire to have this as a reflection of that.

This is a little app written in [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/ "Sinatra"), utilising [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Daring Fireball: Markdown") for the markup (handled by [Maruku](http://github.com/nex3/maruku "nex3's maruku at master - GitHub")), backed up by MySQL. It's hosted on Apache/Passenger at [Prgmr.com](http://prgmr.com/xen/ "Linux and NetBSD Xen VPS hosting.").

The code is also on [GitHub](http://github.com/nickcharlton/nickcharlton.net "nickcharlton's nickcharlton.net at master - GitHub"). Including most of the content.

## Plans

* Open Source the underlying "blogging engine", as a project called "Sinba".
* Use it to dump notes as I work on projects.
* Document a few things released, or nearing release.

## Future

Over the Summer I have (through my Dad) scored a two month Sysadmin Job at ADNEC, in Abu Dhabi. Around this time last year, I spent two days doing some work experience. Which, apart from being brilliant (there's nowhere you can find a better mix of people than abroad) and educational, was very useful to me. 

For the evenings, I have a few things rolled up my sleeve. As usual, there's a lot of things I'd like to learn, from iPhone OS Programming, to some C stuff. But, mostly, I want to go into September with at least a few simple projects up my sleeve, and something bid nearly there.

Ready? Let's Begin.
