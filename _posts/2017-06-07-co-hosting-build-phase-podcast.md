I now co-host a podcast!

A few weeks ago, I agreed to take over co-hosting [Build Phase][], our podcast
about mobile (mostly iOS) development. I'm joining [Jack Nutting][], who used
to work with us in Stockholm.

Podcasting is something I've wanted to do for a long time, but without someone
prompting me, I was going to keep avoiding it. Fortunately, Jack knows what
he's doing and helped make the first episode pretty painless. We'll be
releasing new episodes every other week from here on out.

In the first episode, I talk a little about my first day at [thoughtbot][]
(which was New Bamboo at the time â€¦ but not for very much longer), building
[Hypermedia][] APIs, managing client expectations, a bit about [Swift
evolution][], and how we're still having to deal with [FTP][].
