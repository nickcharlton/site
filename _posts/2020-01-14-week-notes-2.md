* Started on a new project this week. I can't tell you about it, other than
  I’ll be writing [React][]. I've traditionally struggled to do enough for the
  knowledge to end up sticking, so I'm hoping this will help,
* I completed my goals planning for the year. Every year I do this it gets
  easier, and this year I'm especially pleased with how specific and actionable
  they've ended up,
* Two days into cycling to work ended up with a puncture on the way home.
  Turned out to likely be something I missed previously: I use
  [Continental Gatorskins][], which has a wire mesh and I think I ran over a
  pin back in December, and the mesh was exposed on the inside. I tidied that
  up, applied some [gorilla tape]() as precaution and was back on the go.
  Let's see how long it lasts this time!
* I spent a bunch of time this week trying to improve my GitHub pull request
  reviewing workflow (I often do very minor edits to people's contributions
  before merging to help get them over the line) and ended up instead blowing
  away someone's changes. Not the most enjoyable thing to do on a Friday
  afternoon! I’ll write this all up once I eventually figure out the best
  workflow.
* Finally, I got my main bike back (it'd been in storage at my parents' since
  doing the [London to Brighton][] last year), so long rides are an option
  again.
