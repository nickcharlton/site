On Saturday, the second version of the [Digital Peninsula Unconference](http://lanyrd.com/2011/digpenII/) was hosted in Exeter, at the Phoenix. After being [volunteered to take some photographs](http://twitter.com/#!/teddilybear/status/68722214702301185), I spent much of the event running about taking them (that's the flaw in having only a 50mm lens available to you). I've posted them on Flickr, but below are a few of the ones I liked best.

The conference overall was pretty good, although it did feel like some of the people were pitching a little bit too much. Given the mostly technical community, it would be nice to hear more about the decisions made behind projects - stuff that's useful to all.

All of these were shot on a Canon 400D, with a 50mm lens. They were shot at ISO1600. It was quite a dark room, so many of the shots taken didn't work out too well. In other news, if [someone wants me to build something for them](http://nickcharlton.net/contact), I could probably get a better lens.
