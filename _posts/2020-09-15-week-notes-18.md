* Unfortunately, as I write this, I have another — hopefully not so long
  lasting — running-related injury as I've pulled a muscle or perhaps sprained
  my right lower leg/ankle. Queue a day of hobbling around the house and
  cursing having stairs,
* My recent injuries have been caused by a combination of things I've been
  gradually understanding over the past year: spending the last decade plus
  generally sitting has caused a hip imbalance (where the muscles at the front
  are much weaker), which leads to bad feet placement (pronation) which in turn
  can lead to various injuries (if you don't have the right sort of support),
* Ironically, standing with the new desk over the past month has likely
  contributed too!
* tl;dr: I need new shoes and to work on improving my gait and strength again.
  [This video has some really good background on it][1],
* In other news, I moved my _Weekly Review_ (this is something I've been meaning
  for months to write up) forward from Monday to Sunday. I find there's enough
  going on that I just can't get a good deep bit of reflection on Monday and so
  I've been skipping through far too quickly. I'm trying this now on a Sunday
  afternoon to see how this goes,
* I've been continuing to [setup the Synology I mentioned last week][2], mostly
  through moving data off ancient, disparate hard drives (including 2TB of old
  backups) into a folder structure I spent far too much time thinking through,
* One of the motivations behind getting the Synology has been to decommission
  the [Hetzner][4] setup ([which I've written about previously][3]) I have and
  set something else up for experiments; this week a [Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X][5]
  arrived which will be part of the network for that. The plan is broadly: move
  any experiments there locally and setup a tunnel to make it accessible.
