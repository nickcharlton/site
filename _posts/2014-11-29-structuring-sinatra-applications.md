title: Structuring Sinatra Applications
tags: sinatra ruby

[Sinatra] is a cool little framework for building web tools in Ruby. I've been
using it for years to build out little examples, tools like [moviesapi][],
experimenting with REST and Hypermedia API design and now I'm using it to build
a relatively complex web service that provides the core of a new project I'm
part of.

But I've never written down how (and why) I structure projects in the way I do.
Being such a tiny framework, Sinatra doesn't impose any pattern on you (both a
blessing and a curse) and after several false starts (especially on the larger
projects), I've found I've settled into a pattern which works very well.

## Small Ones

The little applications are easy, it's just one file called `app.rb`. This is
most often a 'classic' application, but sometimes it can be a 'modular' one
instead. For example:

```ruby
# app.rb
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  'Hello World!'
end
```

The directory structure will usually end up looking something like this:

```
.
├── Rakefile
├── app.rb
├── config.ru
└── spec
    ├── app_spec.rb
    └── spec_helper.rb
```

Directories like `models` or `lib` fit quite well into the top level like `spec`
does. [moviesapi][] provides a good working example of this.

## Big Ones

The structure for small applications doesn't scale out very well because of the
focus on one single file. Once I've reached (or expect to reach) the stage where
I have several well grouped set of routes, I start to follow a [Rails][]-like
MVC pattern. This splits the routes into separate classes, almost exactly how
Rails handles things. Some of this originally came from [Sinatra: Up and
Running][sinatra-book] which gives a nice overview.

(Sometimes, using Rails is still a better approach than replicating it's
structure like this. I keep with Sinatra for machine facing projects like APIs
once they get this big, anything else would be Rails.)

This structure looks a lot like this:

```
.
├── Rakefile
├── app
│   ├── controllers
│   │   ├── application_controller.rb
│   │   └── example_controller.rb
│   ├── helpers
│   │   └── application_helper.rb
│   └── views
│       ├── example.erb
│       ├── layout.erb
│       └── not_found.erb
├── config.ru
└── spec
    ├── controllers
    │   ├── application_controller_spec.rb
    │   └── example_controller_spec.rb
    ├── helpers
    │   └── application_helper_spec.rb
    └── spec_helper.rb
```

Here, `app.rb` has been broken out into a directory called `app` instead. Inside
this are the `controllers`, `helpers`, `views` (and probably also `models`, too)
which make up the application. In practice, each of the controllers inherit from
`Sinatra::Base` and so we keep the simple route call feature of the original
style and by inheriting from a common `application_controller` we can provide a
few common configuration settings all around.

The `ApplicationController` subclass could be as simple as just:
`class ApplicationController; end`, which should keep each of our controller
subclasses easy to reuse and test.

The `ApplicationController` and `ExampleController` look like this:

```ruby
# application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < Sinatra::Base
  helpers ApplicationHelper

  # set folder for templates to ../views, but make the path absolute
  set :views, File.expand_path('../../views', __FILE__)

  # don't enable logging when running tests
  configure :production, :development do
    enable :logging
  end
end
```

```ruby
# example_controller.rb
class ExampleController < ApplicationController
  get '/' do
    'Example!'
  end
end
```

`config.ru` is used to bring everything up together and this looks like this:

```ruby
# config.ru
require 'sinatra/base'

# pull in the helpers and controllers
Dir.glob('./app/{helpers,controllers}/*.rb').each { |file| require file }

# map the controllers to routes
map('/example') { run ExampleController }
map('/') { run ApplicationController }
```

My biggest use of this structure has been on a recent project with a lot of
routes that have been exposed. It's worked really well so far. That said, a lot
of my projects are of the much smaller type &mdash; the kind of projects where
Sinatra has always worked really well.
