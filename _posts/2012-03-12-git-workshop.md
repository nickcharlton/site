On Saturday, [Chris Hunt](http://thisisthechris.co.uk/) and I gave a workshop on Git at Digpen IV in Exeter. It seemed to go rather well. 

In fact, the whole day was excellent. An afternoon of interesting, detailed and well choreographed sessions. You can find a collection of them over on [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2012/digpen/). Most have slides and there's videos, too.

The slides can be found on [Speaker Deck](http://speakerdeck.com/u/nickcharlton/p/getting-started-with-source-control-and-git). There's a [repository over on GitHub](http://github.com/nickcharlton/git-workshop) with the rest of the resources.

I gather I also agreed to do a follow on session at a future one. So, with that in mind, shout if you have something in mind that you'd like covered.
