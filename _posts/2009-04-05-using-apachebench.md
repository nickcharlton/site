title: Using 'ab', ApacheBench to test Web Server Performance
tags: 
---

<p>ApacheBench (referred to as 'ab' in the terminal) is a tool for testing web server performance by allowing you to test how long a set of requests per second the web server is capable of serving. </p>

<p>Whilst this does not reflect a model of real world usage, it can aid in the tweaking and performance improvement of the Web Server itself.</p>

<p>This tool is of course aimed at testing Apache servers, however it can be used on others.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Usage is rather simple. At it's core, the amount of requests to complete and the url to test are required. On top of this you may inform the application to carry out more than one request at a time, as show in the second example.</p>

<pre LANG="Bash">
   $ ab -n 100 http://domain/

   $ ab -n 100  -c 3 http://domain/
</pre>

<p>When this is run the specified web page is downloaded and the time taken for it to happen is measured.</p>

<h2>Some Results</h2>

<p>These are the results I gained from running this against the server behind this, testing using 3 concurrent connections and 100 requests.</p>

<pre lang="Bash">
$ ab -n 100 -c 3 http://nickcharlton.net/

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>ApacheBench does not however give you a figure to suggest how many requests a server may complete, or reflect the usage which will be shown with a real set of users. This is because any given page or application may consist of many requests</p>

<h2>What to do with the Results?</h2>

<p>The results which you gain are specifically useful in tweaking settings regarding the web server itself. Whilst ApacheBench cannot directly tell you what needs tweaking, once you start changing settings you can realise what is best for your server.</p>
