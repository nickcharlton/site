Well over a year ago, we worked on a project that used barcode scanners.
Knowing that they're just human interface devices (keyboards) in most cases
(and/or can be configured as such), it makes them quite easy to work with in a
typical browser-based testing framework. But putting these two things together
wasn't very clear to most of my colleagues (and probably not to most people
either!).

My colleague Silumesii took the time to write it up (we started working on this
together, so I've got an author credit, but it's really all of his work getting
published!):
