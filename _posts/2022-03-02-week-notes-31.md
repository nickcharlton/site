* I've been jumping back into open source recently, plus doing a lot of
  technical writing for work,
* I [released v0.17.0 of Administrate][2] the other week, which catches up on
  a whole load of contributions after nearly a year,
* Next is going to be a big breaking change, as we remove a lot of
  dependencies (like [`datetime_picker_rails`][3]) and make the biggest change
  so far to how assets are handled. We'll likely be removing Sass completely
  and moving to standard CSS, which I'm quite excited about, but the big news
  is that it'll work much nicer with all of the Rails asset changes which have
  happened recently,
* Technical writing is hard â€” I've been doing a bunch of it, and trying to
  distill down a lot of the way receipt printers work so that others' can read
  one guide. I'm hoping this will turn into a series of blog posts, but that's
  going to take much longer!
* I enjoyed
  [the latest Speedshop newsletter on different styles of open source contribution][1],
* Finally, last week I went to see [Wolf Alice][4]. Standing in a crowd of
  people listening to music is great.
