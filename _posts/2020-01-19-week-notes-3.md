* New office, new cycle route for the first half of the week. This always
  throws out the routine for a little bit, but you get used to it soon enough,
* With this project I'm trying out a new tactic: [pairing by default]. I'm
  starting from a position of not being confident in the technologies we’re
  using, so that's helping me. Plus I'm trying to solve a problem I regularly
  have, which is to fall deeply into a specific problem at the expense of the
  overall goal. I'm hoping by instead asking, "shall we pair on this?" we ask
  "why shouldn't we be pairing on this?",
* This week I really enjoyed [Cadence][] by [William Van Hecke][], who
  previously worked on [OmniFocus][]. It fits well into what I've been starting
  to do recently: focusing on building habits ([something I see][]
  [come up more often][]), thinking about the long-scale things I want to do
  and reviewing it regularly. But also: keeping _loads_ of notes (mostly with
  [Notion][], some on paper), using [the crappiest notebook I could get myself
  to like][] and staying no to things that don't fit in the bigger plan,
* Related to that, this week I planned out three [bikepacking][] trips and a
  weekend to brew some beer (something which without planning is impossible to
  make happen), but also decided to not do another handful of things. It's a
  weird feeling.
* Tortoise did a good series on Trees; about planting, to capture CO2 and the
  science behind it. [I’d recommend starting with _Plant a Trillion
  Trees_][tortoise].
* And related to that, this week I started (and then finished!) reading
  [Getting Started in Your Own Wood][]. Owning a wood is one of those ideas
  that comes back to me every so often, did so again recently, and this time I
  decided to go a bit deeper into working out what that might be like. Still
  much, much more to look into.
