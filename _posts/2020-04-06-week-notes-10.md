* Double digits! I've written ten of these now. It's gradually becoming a
  habit, especially once I've noted at least one thing down during the week,
* This week I moved everything over to [Drafts][1]. Previously I was using
  [Bear][2] (which is a great app), and then sort of using both tools whilst I
  figured this out,
* But the interesting bit isn't the tool, it's the habit formation: I write
  nearly everything first in Drafts before moving it elsewhere (be it Basecamp
  messages, GitHub issue replies or emails), keep notes on everything during
  the day and use it to write out my thoughts before saying them,
* We're now three weeks into full working from home because of COVID-19. I'm
  used to it now, even though I was struggling with the lack of my usual level
  of exercise and then not being able to sleep very well,
* I join more remote calls from my desk now, so now I'm wondering how to make
  remote calls better, should I [upgrade the video][4], [or the audio][3], or
  both?
* We started a new planning approach [on Administrate by starting to use GitHub
  projects][5]. The intention here is to highlight work-in-progress, which was
  previously hidden, and to set expectations for if something is soon likely
  to make it into a release,
* I use [Octobox][6] for keeping on top of my GitHub notifications and for the
  first time in years, I got to inbox zero! For the last few months, I'd been
  hovering around 25 items much of the time, but was never able to get it any
  lower. As I write this it's 3 things.
