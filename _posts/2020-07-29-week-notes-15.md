* I haven't written these for a few weeks as pretty much every week has become
  the same thing and then you realise it's been quite a long timeâ€¦
* A few weekends ago, I had my first actual pint in a pub and it was a strange
  experience and not quite the full experience I'd hoped for. But it's a start!
* I've been out doing long-cycles again in the much nicer weather and
  [I have new gravel tyres][1] which should be much better on that sort of
  terrain that I've been getting into more so now,
* I've also picked up [a frame bag (something I wanted already for bike
  packing)][2], but has now become a permanent fixture on the bike holding a
  spare tube, pump, battery, tools and some snacks,
* I made a [Drafts][4] [action to extract a selection from one Draft into
  another][3]. I had a long list of 1-on-1 notes in one long draft, which was
  starting to be unmanageable, so I've now split them into lots of smaller
  drafts quite easily,
* We started a new project with [Makers Academy][5], having three people who
  recently graduated work on [Administrate][6] for a few months. It's been
  going well so far,
* Finally, after being unable to for the past three-months, I'm able to run
  again and that's been such a significant one for me to miss.
