# Week Notes #14

* Since my last post, I published [_Setting Jenkins Credentials with
  Groovy_][1]. I've been using some of the extra time I've had from lockdown to
  wrap up some things I started years ago and this is part of the same thread.
  There's a few more posts to come related to this before I get onto something
  a bit more interesting,
* But now that the weather has gotten much hotter, I've been spending more time
  outside. I grew a bunch of plants last year and I'm doing the same this year.
  To start off with, I've been trying to make everything a bit easier than it
  was last year (I had too many plants and so watering took ages!),
* One of the goals this year was to make the lawn look better and so last
  weekend, I sowed grass seed. To avoid having all of the seed eaten, I built
  twelve stakes to make a platform for mounting netting over. I also did a
  temporary extension of the garden tap to make access to water much less of a
  pain,
* This weekend, I started building some window boxes & planters out of some
  scrap wood I'd collected over the past few years. There's a photo below.
  There's something really nice about working with scrap wood; this is all from
  old shipping pallets which shouldn't be burned (they contain chemicals to
  protect the wood) so it's really cool to see them get more life.
