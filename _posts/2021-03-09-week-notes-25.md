* I just finished four sessions of physio: I'd been limping everywhere since
  before Christmas, but now I'm all back to running which after so much pain is
  excellent,
* Plus, starting the longer rides again as I start to build up the fitness for
  cycling again, but [mostly so I can spend some time away from the concrete of
  London][1]!
* It's been very satisfying to get back into writing â€” more to come here,
* I've been working a bunch on converting some projects to [GitHub Actions for
  CI: a few of them (particularly Administrate) are fairly slow][2], which is
  partly the speed of tests itself, but mostly because we just keep sitting in
  queues to run the jobs,
* Second beer, this time a "California Common", which is close to a lager-style
  ale and the first one which really needed [the Brew Fridge][3] to make work.
