* A busy couple of months or so, which so easily ends up breaking the habit of
  writing something regularly,
* It's mostly been work, my current project â€” which involves building lots of
  different bits of software and some hardware integration â€” has been fairly
  intense recently, but I've also been learning to drive (which I picked up
  again after a 10 year hiatus),
* This has all lead to my previously delightfully minimalist one computer, one
  monitor and tidy desk setup to have another monitor, another computer and
  various bits of hardware spread everywhere (two receipt printers, three
  laptops with my own counted and an industrial Windows tablet). It's been
  the most interesting and challenging thing I've ever worked on,
* I've had more opportunities to write TypeScript, and most recently C# which
  is not something I've done since University. I'm a fan; especially when tied
  with Visual Studio,
* The most noticeable thing is strongly typed languages when it comes to
  refactoring. The initial process of getting going might well be slower, but
  the middle of a project and onwards is so much easier,
* I've also ended up reading a bunch of technical books lately:
  [_Domain Driven Design Distilled_][1] (I'd recommend it),
  [_Building Event-Driven Microservices_][2] (I'm about half way through, and
  using DDD to think about breaking up services through events seems to fit so
  nicely), and [_C# In Depth_][3] (although this was a bit too â€¦in depth so
  far),
* I'm extremely far behind in all of my open source notifications, partly
  through having much less time at thoughtbot whilst we try out a short Friday
  experiment, so if you're waiting on something, sorry about that,
* Finally, I got around to upgrading my Mac to Big Sur (a year after it was
  released) and thought sod-it and immediately jumped onto the Monterey beta
  with the RC. It's been great so far, so ðŸ¤ž
