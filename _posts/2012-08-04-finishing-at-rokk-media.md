And, so, that is the end of my placement. The conclusion of a year of working
– and learning – is quite a sad one. I've really enjoyed it. I've been able to
work on a diverse range of projects, from web stuff across to several
iOS projects. And, ontop of that, working with a great group of people. I'll
miss it quite a lot.

There's a lot to be said for being able to write code everyday for just over
a year. But, on top of this, get advice, support and different constraints from
what I've previously experienced on my own projects and those through
University.

There are often pinacle points in your life where you go "yes, this was damn
important and influential". This was one of them.

So, thanks Adam, Tristan and the other people at Rokk Media. It was a great year.
