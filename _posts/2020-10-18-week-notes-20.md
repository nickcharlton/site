* A second week of doing my own stuff; much of the same but a relaxing way to
  spend a week as I get around to some things I've wanted to do for months,
* I started off by spending a day doing some workflow improvements:
  - I switched from [Magnet][6] to [Rectangle][7] for macOS window management,
  - Started the move to [kitty][9], with a hurdle around first removing
  [`base16`][8] which I'd previously been using to handle colours. It worked
  really well, but now I've learned more about ANSI colours I've found I can do
  the bits I want manually …but I didn't quite start on this yet,
* More [Tailwind][10] this week, finishing up the menu for the side project
  I've been working on and then doing a little "accounts" view so there's
  something to see once you're logged in,
* In implementing this accounts view (it's a list of bank accounts a user
  has), I used this as the opportunity to try out [ViewComponent][11]. I
  found that it fit really nicely between being able to test drive a view and
  not write a heavyweight feature/system test with the added advantage of
  knowing that reusing components would be much easier in future,
* I switched gears at the end of the week to pick up some maintenance of a
  project I started about four years ago for notifying you on library
  releases and I never launched. It's kinda not necessary now as GitHub does
  have a native feature for it, but I'd wanted something to build on to track
  a few other things so I picked it back up. I got it working again (I'd
  broken the background jobs at some point), [replaced Neat with CSS Grid][3]
  and then came up a with a short list of things to do to actually launch it,
* In my continuing discovery of _Linux on the Desktop_ (with a barebones
  Debian and i3), I learned about [UEFI SecureBoot][12] and signed a kernel
  module, plus made both audio and the backlight keys work]. As I write this,
  I still can't quite copy and paste how I'd like,
* I always enjoy [_The Margins_][2], a newsletter by Can Durak and Ranjan
  Roy, [but this weeks' on how to consume news][1] was particularly good,
* I've also been enjoying reading the [Tailscale][5] blog and
  [this on how they traverse NAT was really interesting][4].
