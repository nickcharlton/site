Tablets and small computers have always interested me. My iPhone is a great little mobile computer - the internet in the palm of your hand, and the rest of that..

The thing is, I've never seen the actual *point* of tablets. They are generally not convenient enough to make them worthwhile, the wrong size, too limited and have an awful input mechanism.

There was an [interesting discussion on Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1077772 "Hacker News | The Healthcare System: An Apple Tablet's Biggest Opportunity") earlier today about tablets in medicine. The article itself suggested that tablets would be a great way for doctors to enter information about patients - forgetting of course that paper has worked wonderfully since pre-Nightingale and such an adaption would be an uphill struggle. Anyway, I digress.

From [my rather biased perspective](http://nickcharlton.net/blog/new-macbook-pro "nickcharlton.net/blog"), I think Apple has done something interesting with the "iPad". 

The interesting bit here, at least, I think, is their showing off of iWork on the device. The biggest issue with such a device is text input. Being just a large screen, there's not the ability to easily enter text. The iPhone isn't a bad, if a little small, but still a pretty good mobile keypad, the iPad is similar, although on a larger scale.

What I can't see though is the gap between the iPhone and the MacBook models. Therefore, I don't think it's revolutionary, at all. 

I find reading to be quite possible on both my iPhone and MacBook Pro, leading me to not need something to fit in that gap. At least, not with just a LCD screen. e-Ink would be something different entirely, reading of an LCD screen is tiring on the eyes.

I can't see why you would use such a device for writing a document when a laptop is far nicer and why you would use such a device for watching TV, recorded or otherwise.

What I do think is clever though is the price point. It's not cheap enough that I would buy one - not least at the 3G end of the scale, but priced cleverly enough to provide another option for people looking for a new machine.

Maybe the revolutionary aspect is producing a excellent, portable device?

I intend to see it pan out, I can't see me buying one, but it's interesting, none-the-less.
