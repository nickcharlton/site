* Back to work last week and it was a good one: started off with helping out
  with a database migration ([DigitalOcean's managed database solution][3] is
  pretty nice!) and then a new project starting with the second phase of a
  project that's just Rails. It's good to be back in the land of Rails, a
  place where I can comfortably test-drive new features in just a few hours
  and really focus about the product we're delivering rather than the minutiae
  of the code,
* I somehow ended up leaving a year (to the month!) in getting back to
  reading [_Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby_][4], but I finished the
  final chapter this week. It's good and well recommended,
* After just short of two weeks using [_Rectangle_][5], I've gotten used to
  it now and it's working great. I generally use four quadrants: Slack,
  Drafts, Mail (although I only open this once in the morning), then often
  Chrome (which I use for work) on one half of the screen. Occasionally I've
  been using a two-thirds/one-third split with Chrome and Drafts for calls,
  as Jira can't quite fit otherwise, my terminal session always fullscreen,
* This weekend saw me tear down the greenhouse that I've had setup for the
  last two years; it was just a plastic tent and in the sun they don't last
  forever. I ended up picking the last two aubergines and the last cucumber
  of the season,
* Then frame three prints that I've been meaning to do for years: one a
  Guinness poster which came in a rotting frame and I finally replaced, an
  early-run of [Cameron Moll's Brooklyn Bridge letterpress print][1] and
  finally a print of the design proof of the BR logo which came out of
  [Wallace Henning's work on the Corporate Identity Manual][2]. It's only
  taken me about 8 years to start doing this!
