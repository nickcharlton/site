For me, iOS 7 is absolutely a watershed moment. All of the advantages of an all-new 
iOS release (marketing, new APIs, much improved personal experience) has thrust me 
into working on new versions of Where's Next? and thinking about how the Predict 
the Sky app will turn out.

I'd be a fool not to want to run with the opportunity and release new versions 
&mdash; especially of Where's Next? &mdash; and get a boost in the store and,
looking at Craig Hockenberry's recent post on [App Updates for iOS 7][hock] it 
doesn't look like I'm alone.
