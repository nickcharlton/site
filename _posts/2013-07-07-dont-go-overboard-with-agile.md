[Jim Bird pulls apart some of the bits of Agile][post].

Unlike most articles on the human side of software development, this brings up
some interesting research on agile principles In the Real World&trade;.

Notably:

1. Tests first or tests after isn't important. Just that they're there.
2. Pair programming as a default option seems to be counterproductive.
2. Remote pair programming (across locations, cultures, etc) doesn't seem to work
   at all.
3. But, as a tool for certain situations (bring in new developers to a codebase or
   solving a specific problem, for example) it works rather well.
4. Daily stand up meetings a bit pointless taken as a constant.

Of course, like a tools, agile can look just like a fancy hammer.
