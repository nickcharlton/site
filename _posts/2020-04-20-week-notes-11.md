* A little while ago, thoughtbot added a new team lead role and I started that
  a week ago when we rolled that out into our London office. It's exciting to
  start doing something a bit different formally,
* Read [_The Coaching Habit_][2]; this was recommended to me by a friend a
  month or so back and it's all about giving less advice and asking more
  questions. I ended up reading it on a sunny bank holiday afternoon in the
  garden and I'd recommend it,
* Less successfully, I spent some time on a bit of a folly of trying to write
  a script to rebuild all gems; I have a lot of Rubies installed from jumping
  around different projects and I _think_ Homebrew broke things by tidying up
  OpenSSL. The main problem I faced is the shell just hanging, which is next to
  impossible to debug. I ended up doing it all manually again and it took hours,
* Over the long weekend, [I solved an issue I'd opened way back in November
  2018][1], which is my way of saying: yeah, I really do get around to things
  eventually,
* One of the problems of long weekends is that open source notifications
  continue along: from a good state of being on top of them, as I write this
  I'm far behind where I'd like to be,
* This past Sunday (19th Apr), I went for a cycle around what's now a very
  empty London, through [a 30km loop from Hyde Park, up to Paddington and back
  through Oxford St][3] it's very strange seeing areas which I'm used to being
  so busy just being devoid of people,
