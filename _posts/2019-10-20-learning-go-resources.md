I'm starting on a Go project for the first time in a while, and a few people
have asked me how to starting writing Go. The last time I spent a significant
amount of time writing Go was over a year ago, so while I also needed to
refresh my knowledge, there have been a few new things released since.

I learn best in two phases: first reading a lot about a subject and then
building something with it. The project itself is the last bit, but going
into it I want to be as ready as I can to hit the ground running. That all
said, _what_ I read is essential. I don't find programming books which walk
through things like type primitives in great depth remotely engaging &mdash;
I want to know just enough to be productive.

I'm assuming that you're coming from the position of already being confident
with a programming language and testing. I don't think I'd start with
learning Go from the beginning.

### [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)

_Learn Go with Tests_ provides a lovely introduction to the basics of Go while
taking you through test-driving what you're learning. This is the first time
I've seen this approach, and I've found it's helped me get back into the
language itself.

### [Go in Practice](http://goinpracticebook.com)

Once you've got an understanding of the basics of Go and have written a little,
I'd recommend _Go in Practice_. It'll run through some common things you'll
need to do and expose you to some patterns as you go. You might well find you
can use the examples mostly as-is, which I find helps in making it feel like
you're making good progress in building something.

I read this cover to cover, but you don't need to do that. I find once I have,
it's much easier for me to pick the book up and refer to something I
then need.

### Ultimate Go Programming Course


Once I've built a few simple projects, I then want to go into some more depth
on how to structure more complex applications. I find this sort of depth
doesn't help until much later on and watching a video course helps keep me
engaged.

I've been finding Bill Kennedy's _Ultimate Go Programming_ fit this well, he's
an engaging teacher and the depth is just right.

### [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com)

Finally, something I refer to regularly that'll help fill in some gaps. I jump
to _Go by Example_ when I broadly know what I'm trying to do, but can't quite
figure out how to do it in Go.

It's how I solve something like: "I need to read a file â€¦how do I do that?"
