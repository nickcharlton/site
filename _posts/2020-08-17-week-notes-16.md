* I made an [example of using Pronto with standardrb that'll run on GitHub
  Actions][1]. It worked out to be one of those things which (mostly) just
  slotted together and worked, which was nice,
* A [warm cycle around London][2] last week, which mostly reminded me how poorly
  thought through much of the cycle infrastructure is in certain boroughs:
  coming off a road into a "dual use" pedestrian/cycling area in a busy shopping
  area is a dreadful bit of street design,
* Over the past few weeks I've been struggling with a mix of back and
  (eventually) shoulder pain which is part stress but also part my desk setup,
* Step 1 was to replace the [old IKEA chair I had][4] (this is a good chair;
  just not for my needs) with one from the office: I now have an [Aeron][5]
  and this made a huge difference,
* Step 2 was to get a standing desk — something I've wanted for years — and so
  [I now have one of those][3] (there's a picture below),
* After a long day, it does seem to have helped a lot. My big hope was to get
  to the end of it and not feel so tired and so far, that's worked out!
