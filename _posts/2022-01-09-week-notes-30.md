* A New Year always brings a new set of optimism, plans and possibilities for
  me and this year is no different,
* Last year was another rough one (who knew living through a pandemic would be
  extremely difficult, even if you never got sick), but we made it,
* A lovely Christmas and New Year, then back where I was previously; trying to
  get my head around Windows, C# and a lot of receipt printer minutiae,
* Later this year, I'm doing the [Frontier 300][2], but I need to get my
  fitness well up from where it is currently so I got a turbo trainer, a
  [Wahoo Kickr Snap][1] which I started using this weekend, it's excellent,
* My plan is to use it through winter to get my cycling fitness back up to
  where it was, and then hopefully, way ahead of wherever I managed to get it
  to previously, probably through [Zwift][3]. My training plan starts tomorrow!
* I note that this is the thirtieth one of these I've done (and with it
  being a new year) feels like a bit of a milestone. I enjoy writing these,
  even if I've skipped _a lot_ recently, onwards!
