[Bill Wasik writes something about IoT over on Wired.][post].

This is probably the first post I've seen at a more mainstream publication which
talks about IoT well and doesn't get it all wrong. 

I also quite like that they use the term, "Sensor Revolution". We're mostly talking 
about adding a layer of sensors to objects, not giving a fridge a web browser.

And, the location stuff reminds me of [Meridian][], and some of the research I'm 
interested in (but my stuff is attached to robots).
