[Alan Winfield presents a short paper on the likelihood of a pending AI winter][post].

> "We need to be truthful about the limitations of robots and robot intelligence, 
> and measured with our predictions. We can show that real robots are both very 
> different and much more surprising than their fictional counterparts"

Of course, articles such as [this by Glenn Greenwald hardly help][guardian]:

> "the most sophisticated robotics use artificial intelligence that [can] seek out 
> and record certain kinds of suspicious activity‚Äù

(Although, I do agree on the privacy, et. al. risks of using surveillance tools 
such as 'drones' in the name of "the public good".)
