Attempting to apply a graph to people works in the first instance. But, whilst we are all connected, we are connected to each other in mind bogglingly different ways. And, people care about that.

Facebook and Google+ are passing phases. Hopefully the end of this phase will hurry up. Pictures of kittens might get tedious, but I can't imagine a web without them. And anyway, ["Liking" is "shit work".](http://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work/).

To me, a more important problem to solve is that of identity. A lot of [smart](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/) [people](http://davidrecordon.com/) were working on things like [OpenID](http://openid.net) (and then they went to work for Google & Facebook. *sigh*.) Whilst I think OpenID had its flaws, every design can be iterated on. The growth of "Sign in with [Twitter/Facebook/Google/etc.]" makes me sad. 

I talked about this briefly at the weekend with [Ben](http://bma.li). We didn't come to much of a solution, other than thinking that something like ssh-agent might work.

As humans, we are too ready and willing to give up the one thing we truly defines us: Our Identity.
