* Just after the last Week Notes post, [I published a short one on configuring
  Jenkins' email-ext plugin][1]. Jenkins, as much as a challenge it is to work
  with, still works the best for running arbitrary jobs and I've been working
  on some infrastructure experiments again,
* [Ubuntu 20.04 came out too][2], and it has a new installer. This lead to
  some experiments with trying out the new automated installer method and
  [eventually this post once I made it all work][3]. I'm now tracking
  [an issue on Packer][4], [an issue on Chef's bento project][5],
  [and another one too][6], as we try and make the new installer work
  everywhere,
* The feedback loop for debugging these things is possibly the worst I've ever
  worked on: the only way to test if a theory works is to go through much of the
  process repeatedly, which means waiting for 5-10 minutes every time. You end
  up reading a lot whilst you wait,
* In more open source news, I'm trying out having [Administrate][7] "Office
  Hours" by allocating two hours every other Friday for people to set a time
  to come with an issue or pair on what I'm looking at. I'm starting this
  internally only for now, but eventually I'd like to expand this out to
  everyone. So, if you're reading this, this is an invitation to ask!
* With an injured leg for the past few weeks (caused by, I think, my old
  running shoes being overdue for replacement), I've been off running for a
  while now,
* But, I've been cycling around an empty London instead, which is eerily
  fascinating.
