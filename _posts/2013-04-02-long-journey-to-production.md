[Rafe Colburn talks about the extra work that is required to take a simple project and push it into production][post].

There's something to be said here as it being the difference between "hacking" and
"software engineering". Software Engineering is all about the other stuff that comes
once you have a something working. It's about elegance, design patterns, testing and
the interactions with operations.

I suppose this is partly why I find DevOps so interesting, it's merging it all
together, demonstrating to both sides of the coin the effort that is required to
have cost effective, reliable services.
