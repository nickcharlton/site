Today marks the start of the second week of my placement (actually, the second day of the second week); doing iOS Development at Rokk Media on the outskirts of Exeter.

My first week has been rather good. The focus so far has been figuring out a few things in iOS on some projects which I hadn't yet come across (including some sensor stuff and 2D game programming, which is rather interesting). I've also pitched in with a couple of web projects.

I'm currently commuting from Plymouth (via Newton Abbot and then onto Exeter St. Thomas) to the office each day. Whilst it does work, it's unfortunately quite exhausting, so the intention is to move to Exeter in the next few weeks (any tips would be awesome!).

So far, all is going well. They're a great bunch of people to work for, so it looks like I'm about to have a pretty good placement year.
