[Tom Morris talks about writing about yourself on your blog][post].

> "As for one’s “personal brand”? Puh-lease. The concept of such a thing is so toxic 
> to human honesty as to make me want to kick a small child. The reason we’ve only

> gay is precisely because of “personal brand”. We’re all too horrified about 
> offending some hypothetical future employer with our opinions or even our very 
> own lives that we hide away from telling anyone anything. Sorry, but I’m with
