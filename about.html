  <p>
    I&rsquo;m a developer living in London, where I spend my time building
    digital products.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the past several years, I&rsquo;ve been
    <a href="https://bikepacking.com">bikepacking</a> over long distances
    (ultra-light bike touring) out in the wilderness which had lead me to some
    wonderful places. I run a lot, too, which helps me switch off.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since 2015, I&rsquo;ve helped build and operate software for clients at
    <a href="https://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a>, where I&rsquo;m now a
    <em>Development Team Lead</em>. I&rsquo;ve helped build out new MVPs for
    startups, re-platform existing solutions, bring new technologies to market
    and navigated complex requirements and legacy infrastructure at larger
    enterprises. I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of working in New York, Berlin,
    Paris and various other places, too.
  </p>

  <p>
    I&rsquo;m also lead maintainer on
    <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate"><em>administrate</em></a>
    (a dashboard library for Rails) and
    <a href="/projects.html"><em>appraisal</em></a> (which lets you try out
    multiple gem versions) and
    <a href="https://github.com/nickcharlton/talks">have spoken at several events about maintaining open source projects</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Prior to thoughtbot, I co-founded a fitness class app startup and before
    then did a bit of freelancing.
